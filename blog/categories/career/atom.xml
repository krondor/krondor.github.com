    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Wow! How long has it been since I last posted?  It's been a hectic half year,
and now it's time for a little introspection.  I've changed careers, in a sense,
to embark on some new things.  For those of you who don't know me, I've spent a
long time in the trenches of enterprise IT.  It's been fun and rewarding, and by
no means a bad experience.  That being said I have noticed myself growing a bit
stir crazy of late.</p>

<p>So, what am I doing exactly?  While I've left my role as an IT Architect and
moved to the dark side.  That is Software Development, although I'm still doing
IT to an extent.  I've always worn multiple hats, so why should this be any
different.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to be on the other side of the IT/Software relationship
though.  I expect I'll have a good deal more to say on that dichotomy...</p>

<p>In the meantime, I'm hoping to get some posts out on some of the things I've
been playing with lately.  Should be some fun things to talk about around
Hadoop, R, MongoDB, Moodle, Juju, and MaaS.  That is if I ever find more time.</p>
