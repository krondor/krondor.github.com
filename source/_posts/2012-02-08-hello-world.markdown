The site is live on <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>, which I recently moved to from <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a>.  It actually wasn't an easy process, but this was mostly my fault.  Once I realized I had no clue what I was doing with Ruby everything went much smoother.  I'll need to throw a more detailed post on the ordeal and some of my thoughts for moving.  I'm going to avoid a howto because there's already plenty of great examples for it (though I'll be sure to link them).  

Hooray for a live blog again.
