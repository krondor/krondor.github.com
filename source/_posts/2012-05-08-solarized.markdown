This blog is now <strong><a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized!</a></strong>  I made the change today, after having already moved to this color scheme in my shell, editor, etc... I'm really enjoying it on my desktop, so I thought why not the blog?  The color scheme is supposed to help reduce eye strain while maintaining nice contrast of content.  That sounds about right for me, living in this sea of florescent light powered cubicles.  

I elected to use the light variant of solarized for the blog content and scheme and use the dark solarized variant for code snippets.  I think it's working out kind of well, but probably needs some tweaks.  

The link above has all the gory details, whereas I'll keep this post a short one and just dump out the gist of the color scheme's SASS CSS.

Happy Hacking!
